      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>
        Electric Callboy (formerly known as Eskimo Callboy) is a German
        electronicore band formed in Castrop-Rauxel in 2010. They take a more
        relaxed approach to the genre, and are known for their comedic songs,
        live shows and videos. The band's musical style can be described as
        electronicore, metalcore, melodic metalcore, post-hardcore, comedy rock,
        dubstep, electro, and EDM. The musicians named bands like Asking
        Alexandria and Attack Attack! as their musical influences. Their singer
        stated that the musicians don't feel like being a part of the "hardcore
        music scene". The lyrics deal with themes such as getting drunk,
        parties, and sex. The band call their music "Porno Metal". In an
        interview with the German FUZE magazine, vocalist Sebastian Biesler
        meant that the lyrics only use clich√©s in a satirical way. In German
        Metal Hammer magazine, the reviewer gave the band a positive critique.
        He wrote, "this is why Eskimo Callboy is fun because they dismiss
        themselves and let ruling the fun".

        The band started recording their second album at Kohlekeller Studios
        together with producer Kristian Kohlmannslehner in autumn of 2013. The
        album, We Are the Mess, was released on 10 January 2014 via Redfield
        Records and Warner Music Japan. The band played five release shows
        in Germany supported by Annisokay. We Are the Mess peaked in 8th place
        on Germany's official long-play charts and in 64th place in Austria. The
        band toured in Japan to promote their album. In March of that year,
        the band toured Europe supported by Iwrestledabearonce, Her Bright Skies
        and To the Rats and Wolves. In August 2019, the band released the
        single "Hurricane" from their fifth studio album. The album, Rehab, was
        released on 1 November 2019. Following the release of Rehab, the
        band embarked on their Rehab European Tour 2019. On 12 February
        2020, the band announced through their social media appearances that the
        previous singer "Sushi" would be leaving the band. "Sushi" went on
        to start a new project called "Ghostkid".
